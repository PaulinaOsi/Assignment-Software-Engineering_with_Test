- Reduce manual processing errors and delays.
- Improve customer service by accelerating the ordering process.
- Achieve a projected 10% increase in revenue within 18 months.
- Reduce the number of sales handler employees by 50% over 18 months.

### Key Responsibilities and Tasks:
1. **Initiation Phase:**
   - Defined critical assumptions and constraints.
   - Established preliminary requirements and potential risks.
   - Created a project charter to measure the success of the project.

2. **Planning Phase:**
   - Developed a comprehensive Work Breakdown Structure (WBS).
   - Defined project scope, deliverables, and schedule.
   - Created scope verification and control plans.

3. **Analysis and Design Phase:**
   - Created various design diagrams, including Context Flow, Use Case, Activity, Class, Sequence, and State diagrams.
   - Analyzed key requirements and designed the system architecture accordingly.

4. **Execution Monitoring and Control Phase:**
   - Implemented risk management strategies and monitored potential risks.
   - Managed project changes through a Change Control Board (CCB).
   - Ensured adherence to project scope, schedule, and budget.

5. **Implementation:**
   - Developed the OPA system using front-end (HTML/CSS/JavaScript) and back-end (Java) technologies.
   - Integrated the system with SQL databases and payment gateways.
   - Conducted unit tests and system integration tests.
   - Migrated existing customer data to the new system.

6. **Closure:**
   - Demonstrated the working system to Bluewater Ltd.
   - Ensured formal acceptance and sign-off of the system by the client.
   - Conducted post-implementation reviews and documented lessons learned.

### Deliverables:
- **Jupyter Notebook:** Detailed documentation of research, design, and implementation processes.
- **Supporting Files:** Additional scripts, images, and data files used in the project.

### Achievements:
- Successfully replaced the cumbersome manual payment system with an automated OPA system.
- Improved the efficiency of Bluewater Ltd's order processing.
- Projected an increase in annual revenue and a reduction in employee overhead.
